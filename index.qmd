## Methods

### Scoping Scopus (Literature Search)

The literature search started with an experimental search in March 2023. The aim of the experimental search of literature is to scout the volume and diversity of the available literature. It was evident from this experiment that there exists a colossal amount of reviews on resilience and not all reviews are equal. This experiment was helpful in further determining the exclusion and inclusion criteria and optimizing the search query as well as the steps for screening review articles.

The Scopus search for literature was conducted on the 3rd of April 2023. There are no publication date limitations, which means that any publication published on or before 3rd of April 2023 are accepted. The review process was assisted by using Rayyan. The schematic, adapted PRISMA representation is shown in the following figure.

The main keywords used in the query for searching on the Scopus database in titles, abstracts, and keywords were "soci\*", "commun\*", "neighbour\*", "urban", "econom\*", "financi\*", "infrastruct\*", "disast\*", "climate" and "resilience". This search query is further restricted by excluding the following keywords in the title-abstract-key: "covid", "corona", "COVID-19", "agri\*", "supply chain", "agro\*", "land", "education", "migration", "sport", "war", "coral", "farm\*" and restricted again with the following keywords in the title: "politics", "policy", "ecosystem", "forest", "worker", "governance", "river", "ecolo\*", "biodiversity", "institution\*", since it is out of scope for the paper. The document type is set to reveal review journal articles only. Obvious subject areas such as medicine, agricultural and biological sciences, psychology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, computer science, neuroscience, nursing, immunology and microbiology, chemical engineering, health professions, physics and astronomy, chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutics, veterinary, dentistry, arts and humanities, business, management and accounting, mathematics, and materials science are all excluded. The language of the review articles is limited to English only. Finally, the search query specifies the following keywords that should appear for inclusion: resilience, climate change,, disasters, and disaster. This search query[^1] resulted in 446 articles in total.

Learning from the experimental search exercise, it was difficult to determine if an article was truly a review article or not by simply scanning from the title, abstract and keywords. It was interesting to point out that even though the filter for review articles was switched on, there were still a myriad of articles that were not review articles to begin with. To further simplify the process, an additional line[^2] in the search query was appended, where it only includes articles that mentions "review", "overview", or "survey" in either title, abstract, or keyword. This additional exclusion resulted in 341 articles awaiting to be screened.

[^2]: AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "review" OR "overview" OR "survey" )

Following the screening of 341 articles, 256 articles were removed due to not being in scope with this paper. The main reasons for removing the articles was that the articles focused on sustainability, nature (such as forests or lakes), governance, health, particular species (such as beetles or plants), technology, etc. Furthering the screening and filtering of articles, 85 reviews were under full-text screening. The purpose of full-text screening is to ensure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. A substantial portion of the articles were removed either due to not being a systematic review or simply not being a review article.

After the full-text screening, the remaining 21 articles were controlled using the Methodological Quality Checklist \<insert citation here, Bird article\>. The checklist consists of 7 questions, and for each question, if the review satisfy the requirement or question, the review receives 1 point, which results in 7 full possible points. The checklist is slightly adapted for question 1, where if there is a clear aim or purpose for the review, then the review itself would satisfy the question. Following the example of Bird (2018), this meta review would include any review that received four or more points, as those were "deemed moderate-to-high quality" (Bird, 2018). Although the checklist may appear simple, but it was a rather effective astringent in determining the quality of the review articles. All except one review satisfy question 5 of the checklist, which asked if the primary studies have been quality assessed. The other question where only 2 reviews satisfied, was about if each stage of the review process have been involved by at least two authors. Finally, this umbrella review proceeds with analysis and synthesis with 11 systematic reviews. The table below lists the final 11 reviews synthesized in this paper.

Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that there weren't any systematic reviews in the category of economic resilience. This points towards a clear avenue of future research.

### Guiding Questions

The synthesis and analysis of the 11 review articles are guided by the following two questions:

1.  How is resilience defined and manifested as indicators in the different resilience streams?

2.  What are the commonalities between these different resilience streams in definition and indicators?

## Results

### Bibliometric Reporting

Of the 11 articles examined in this article, 7 papers could be classified as related to measuring the resilience of infrastructures, 2 papers concerns community resilience, 1 paper on organizational resilience, and another paper on urban resilience. The years of publication of the included articles spans from 2017 to 2023. This is unsurprising as systematic reviews were originally from the field of health and only started diversifying in the early 2000s `Systematic reviews: A brief historical overview`. The total number of articles that were included in the 11 papers is 829 articles, with an average of 75.4 articles and standard deviation of 74 articles. Furthermore, the paper with the least amount of articles is `coastal community paper`, with 9 articles reviewed and the paper with the highest amount of articles is `infrastructure resilience curves` with 273 papers. The median of articles included for review across all papers is 50.

The average number of authors across the 11 review articles is 3.5, with a standard deviation of 1.6. The highest amount of authorship in a paper is 7 `Resilience theory article`, and the least amount of authors in a review paper is 1 `Indicators to assess article`. Out of the 11 articles included in this article, 6 were published by Elsevier, 3 by Emerald, 1 by Springer and another 1 by Taylor & Francis. The 11 articles also demonstrated the use of different database in their literature search, with an average of 1.6 databases consulted. Scopus was the most popular database, with 7 uses, which follows closely with Web of Science with 6 uses. The other databases consulted were Google Scholar (2 instances), ScienceDirect (2 instances), and IEEE Xplore (1 instance).

### Resilience Definitions

The various definitions are scraped from each review paper. Some papers try to synthesize the definition of resilience `put some example papers here and their citation\`, and some papers will propose their own definition of resilience `example papers here`, while a paper (Cariolet) will simply use a widely cited definition. This particular sub-section aims to explore the conceptualization of resilience through the various definitions mentioned using word clouds and term frequency (and maybe more?)
