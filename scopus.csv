In this regard, during the last couple of years, many governments have put a lot of efforts into building resilient urban communities. Essentially, a resilient urban community has the capacity to anticipate future disasters, prepare for and recover timely from adverse effects of disasters and unexpected circumstances. Considering this, it is therefore important for the need to continuously review the existing urban community resilience indicators, in order to identify emerging ones to enable comprehensive evaluation of urban communities in the future against unexpected events. This study therefore aims to conduct a systematic review to develop and critically analyse the emerging and leading urban community resilience indicators. Design/methodology/approach: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRSIMA) protocol, 53 journal articles were selected using Scopus. The selected papers were subjected to thorough content analysis. Findings: From the review, 45 urban community resilience indicators were identified. These indicators were grouped into eight broad categories namely, Socio-demographic, Economic, Institutional Resilience, Infrastructure and Housing Resilience, Collaboration, Community Capital, Risk Data Accumulation and Geographical and Spatial characteristics of community. Further, the results indicated that the U.S had the highest number of publications, followed by Australia, China, New Zealand and Taiwan. In fact, very few studies emanated from developing economies. Originality/value: The outputs of this study will inform policymakers, practitioners and researchers on the new and emerging indicators that should be considered when evaluating the resilience level of urban communities. The findings will also serve as a theoretical foundation for further detailed empirical investigation. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Criteria; Disasters; Indicators; Resilience; Urban community",,,,,,"Aksha, S.K., Emrich, C.T., Benchmarking community disaster resilience in Nepal (2020) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17 (6), p. 1985; Alinovi, L., Mane, E., Romano, D., Measuring household resilience to food insecurity: application to Palestinian households (2009) Ec-Fao Food Security Programme Rom, pp. 1-39; Allen, B., Stacey, B.C., Bar-Yam, Y., Multiscale information theory and the marginal utility of information (2017) Entropy, 19, p. 273; Ampratwum, G., Tam, V.W.Y., Osei-Kyei, R., Critical analysis of risks factors in using public-private partnership in building critical infrastructure resilience: a systematic review (2023) Construction Innovation, 23 (2), pp. 360-382; Asadzadeh, A., Kötter, T., Zebardast, E., An augmented approach for measurement of disaster resilience using connective factor analysis and analytic network process (F’ANP) model (2015) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 14, pp. 504-518; Aslani, F., Amini Hosseini, K., Fallahi, A., A framework for earthquake resilience at neighborhood level (2020) International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment, 11, pp. 557-575; Béné, C., Al-Hassan, R.M., Amarasinghe, O., Fong, P., Ocran, J., Onumah, E., Ratuniata, R., Mills, D.J., Is resilience socially constructed?

The absence of a universally accepted definition for CIs hinders one's attempts at building the resilience of CIs against disasters. Identification of damage reduction measures is vital in decision-making to achieve the required disaster resilience in following established frameworks. Target D of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) mainly emphasises the substantial reduction of disaster damages to the CIs through improving resilience within them. This study aims to develop a set of measures for achieving SFDRR target D using a systematic literature review. This study aims to identify a universal definition of CIs through critical indicators and propose optimum measures for enhancing the resilience of CIs. Twelve indicators are proposed under three aspects (resilience, environmental and sustainability, and socio-economic) to identify the CIs. Furthermore, eight measures were identified to achieve SFDRR target D. The identified measures were applied using CI examples to demonstrate that outcomes can be applied to enhance the existing governance systems of CIs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Critical infrastructure; Criticality assessment; Damage reduction; Disaster risk reduction; Disasters; Resilience; Sendai framework",,,,,,"Panda, A., Ramos, J.N., Making Critical Infrastructure Resilient: Ensuring Continuity of Service Policy and Regulations in Europe and Central Asia (2020), www.undrr.org; Monstadt, J., Schmidt, M., Urban resilience in the making?

Nevertheless, very few of these approaches address systemic risks, particularly in multi-hazard environments, and thus do not holistically contribute to decision making in various contexts. This paper addresses this gap by means of a critical review and an assessment of approaches to climate and disaster resilience measurement with a particular focus on three issues: (1) the consideration of compounding socioeconomic and climatic risks in approaches to resilience measurement; (2) the methodological and technical aspects of resilience measurement; and (3) the application and practicability of resilience measurement across various contexts to reliably inform decision-making processes. Seventeen key resilience measurement approaches developed by researchers, government, and private and civil society organizations are selected and evaluated according to a set of assessment criteria. Based on this assessment, we conclude with three key findings. First, we find a lack of clear standards and validated approaches in the measurement methodologies, which can lead to inconsistencies and poor data comparability. Second, approaches to resilience measurement should further strive to combine both process- and outcome-based methodological perspectives to represent resilience in the most holistic and standardized manner possible. Third, in the context of multiple hazards, decision-making strategies should address multiple vulnerabilities. To conclude, we suggest that future developments in resilience measurement should allow for the analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales and among systemic risks. Moreover, more rigorous process-based approaches to resilience measurement are still required that can incorporate outputs into decision making. © 2022","Climate; Comprehensive risk management; Decision support; Multiple hazard; Resilience measurement; Review",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Social and ecological resilience: are they related?

They ensure the interconnectivity and good operability of any major urban environment. CIs are exposed to several disruptions such as natural events, hazards or threats that may disturb their normal functionality. These disruptions may impact societies not only from a socio-economic perspective but also environmentally. Therefore, ensuring the resilience of CIs is crucial to modern cities. This paper aims to explore the main standards and criteria used to assess the resilience of CIs. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage systematic review process was adopted to retrieve relevant papers. A total of 44 papers were carefully selected, and the content analysis technique was used to thoroughly analyse the papers. Findings: Results show that researchers’ interest to investigate the assessment criteria of CIs resilience increased after 2004. Further, a total of 28 resilience criteria of CIs were identified, of which the most reported ones are organisational resilience; performance loss, disruption and recovery process; resilience metrics and index; safety, security and risk analysis; societies/communities’ resilience and/or social-equity responsibility; dynamic networks connectivity; resilience through design and structural integrity; and economic resilience. Originality/value: The findings of this research will serve as a solid foundation for the development of hypothesis for future empirical studies into the development of assessment criteria index for CI resilience. Further, the outcomes will contribute to the ongoing international discussions and debate on the appropriate ways to develop CI resilience. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Criteria; Critical infrastructure; Resilience; Standards","Public works; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Assessment criteria; Built environment; Criteria; Exposed to; Infrastructure resiliences; Interconnectivity; Natural hazard; Resilience; Systematic Review; Urban environments; Critical infrastructures",,,,,"Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., A security analysis for wireless sensor mesh networks in highly critical systems (2010) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews), 40 (4), pp. 419-428; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Choo, K.-K.R., Resilient interconnection in cyber-physical control systems (2017) Computers and Security, 71, pp. 2-14; Alizadeh, H., Sharifi, A., Assessing resilience of urban critical infrastructure networks: a case study of Ahvaz, Iran (2020) Sustainability, 12 (9), p. 12; Anwar, Z., Campbell, R., Automated assessment of compliance with security best practices (2008) International Conference on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 290, pp. 173-187; Argyroudis, S.A., Fotopoulou, S., Karafagka, S., Pitilakis, K., Selva, J., Salzano, E., Basco, A., Matos, J.P., A risk-based multi-level stress test methodology: application to six critical non-nuclear infrastructures in Europe (2020) Natural Hazards, 100 (2), pp. 595-633; Argyroudis, S.A., Fotopoulou, S., Karafagka, S., Pitilakis, K., Selva, J., Salzano, E., Basco, A., Mignan, A., A risk-based multi-level stress test methodology: application to six critical non-nuclear infrastructures in (2019) Natural Hazards, 100 (2), pp. 595-633; Armenakis, C., Nirupama, N., Prioritization of disaster risk in a community using GIS (2012) Natural Hazards, 66 (1), pp. 15-29; (2020) Security of critical infrastructure act 2018, , www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/security-coordination/security-of-critical-infrastructure-act-2018, available: (accessed, Australian Government Department of Home Affairs, 27 Jan 2021; Bellini, E., Gaitanidou, E., Bekiaris, E., Ferreira, P., The Resolute project’s European resilience management guidelines for critical infrastructure: development, operationalisation and testing for the urban transport system (2020) Environment Systems and Decisions, 40 (3), pp. 321-341; Blake, D.M., (2016) Impacts of volcanic ash on surface transportation networks: considerations for Auckland city, , New Zealand; Braghin, S., Trombetta, A., Fovino, I.N., Advanced trust negotiations in critical infrastructures (2010) International Journal of Critical Infrastructures, 6 (3), pp. 1-6; Cantu, J., Gharehyakheh, A., Fritts, S., Tolk, J., Assessing the HRO: tools and techniques to determine the high-reliability state of an organization (2021) Safety Science, 134, p. 105082; Cassottana, B., Shen, L., Tang, L.C., (2019) Modeling the Recovery Process: A Key Dimension of Resilience.

Generally, these curves illustrate the evolution of system performance before, during, and after a disruption. As simple as these curves may appear, the literature contains underexplored nuance when defining “performance” and comparing curves with summary metrics. Through a critical review of 273 publications, this manuscript aims to define a common vocabulary for practitioners and researchers that will improve the use of resilience curves as a tool for assessing and designing resilient infrastructure. This vocabulary includes a taxonomy of resilience curve performance measures as well as a taxonomy of summary metrics. In addition, this review synthesizes a framework for examining assumptions of resilience analysis that are often implicit or unexamined in the practice and literature. From this vocabulary and framework comes recommendations including broader adoption of productivity measures; additional research on endogenous performance targets and thresholds; deliberate consideration of curve milestones when defining summary metrics; and cautionary fundamental flaws that may arise when condensing an ensemble of resilience curves into an “expected” trajectory. © 2021 The Author(s)","Critical infrastructure; Metrics; Performance measures; Resilience; System analysis","Critical infrastructures; Systems analysis; Critical infrastructure; Infrastructure resiliences; Metric; Performance measure; Qualitative aspects; Resilience; Simple++; System behaviors; System resiliences; Systems performance; Taxonomies",,,,,"Disaster resilience: a national imperative (2012), https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13457/disaster-resilience-a-national-imperative, National Academies Press Washington, DC Accessed: Jan. 16, 2019.

CIs produce and distribute essential goods or services, as for power transmission systems, water treatment and distribution infrastructures, transportation systems, communication networks, nuclear power plants, and information technologies. Being resilient becomes a key property for CIs, which are constantly exposed to threats that can undermine safety, security, and business continuity. Nowadays, a variety of approaches exist in the context of CIs’ resilience research. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the approaches that have a complete qualitative dimension, or that can be used as entry points for semi-quantitative analyses. The study aims to uncover the usage of qualitative research methods through a systematic review based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The paper identifies four principal dimensions of resilience referred to CIs (i.e., techno-centric, organisational, community, and urban) and discusses the related qualitative methods. Besides many studies being focused on energy and transportation systems, the literature review allows to observe that interviews and questionnaires are most frequently used to gather qualitative data, besides a high percentage of mixed-method research. The article aims to provide a synthesis of literature on qualitative methods used for resilience research in the domain of CIs, detailing lessons learned from such approaches to shed lights on best practices and identify possible future research directions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Critical infrastructure; Infrastructure resilience; Resilience engineering; Resilience management; Review","business development; infrastructure; literature review; qualitative analysis; research work",,,,,"Adini, B., Cohen, O., Eide, A.W., Striving to be resilient: What concepts, approaches and practices should be incorporated in resilience management guidelines?

The first step in improving urban resilience to climate-related disasters is the assessment of current levels of resilience. Through a systematic review, this study aims to answer the following questions about current urban resilience assessment: 1) what are the most common characteristics of urban resilience; 2) what are the most commonly involved dimensions of urban ecosystems; and 3) what are most frequently applied methods. This study concludes by providing recommendations for future resilience assessments, including the employment of more holistic assessments for urban ecosystems as a whole and in parts and a unifying framing based on urban resilience characteristics for comparing resilience assessments across studies. This review of current resilience assessment literature can be a starting point for scholars and practitioners to optimize resilience assessments and, in turn, improve urban resilience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment; Climate-related disasters; Urban ecosystems; Urban resilience",,,,,,"Brussels, C.R.E.D., Natural Disasters 2018 (2019), Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters; Ritchie, H., Roser, M., Urbanization (2018), Our World Data; Grimm, N., Grove, M., Pickett, S.T.A., Redman, C., Integrated approaches to long-TermStudies of urban ecological systems (2009) Bioscience, 50, pp. 571-584; Grove, M., Jr, W., A Social Ecology Approach and Applications of Urban Ecosystem and Landscape Analyses: A Case Study of Baltimore (1997), 1. , Urban Ecosyst Maryland; Pickett, S.T.A., Grove, J.M., Urban ecosystems: what would Tansley do?

Resilience assessment comprises the pre-event oriented classical risk assessment as a central element, but it goes beyond that because it also includes and evaluates post-event strategies to improve the functioning of the system during its future operation. First, an overview of resilience definitions used across various scientific disciplines is presented, followed by an in-depth analysis of resilience assessment and quantification for energy systems. The relevant literature is classified by approach and according to four key functions of resilience: resist, restabilize, rebuild, and reconfigure. Findings show that irrespective of the research field, a resilient system always operates with an aim to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a disruptive event and to efficiently recover from a potential system performance loss. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the framework is criticised for lacking an inclusive evaluation of resilience despite accepting it as a component of sustainability. Many resilience indicators have been proposed in the literature with the potential to be introduced in SDGs. Yet, the initial challenge is the lack of an agreement on resilience dimensions and a common framework of indicators to measure them. In this review, key resilience dimensions (KDs), as well as the related objective indicators, are defined through the review of the resilience literature, from 1970 to the present day. Here, 21 different resilience dimensions, along with the indicators to assess them, have been extracted. Conducting the framework analysis method, the indicators related to each dimension have been coded based on variables (that categorise indicators due to the measured features) and sub-domains (that classify variables in overall themes). Later, similarity matrices are developed to define the strength of the codes' co-occurrence among 21 dimensions. Consequently, five KDs were conceptualised - social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, and environmental. The KDs have been later utilised as a context on which indicators to measure resilience have been formulated in a comprehensive framework. This framework, as well as resolving the disagreement on resilience dimensions and their proliferation, supports the refinement of future indicators and enhancement of resilience measurement in SDGs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Objective indicator; Quantitative measurement; Resilience dimension; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)",,,,,,"(2015) Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; (2016) Report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators; (2020) Global Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and Targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; Cutter, S.L., The landscape of disaster resilience indicators in the USA (2016) Nat.

Recent research highlights how resilience is enhanced through the use of “big data” technologies that improve the speed and effectiveness of linkages between disaster information and systemic response. Summarizing and discussing this research, this study highlights and substantiates the potential of big data strategies to help mitigate the risks and impact of socio-ecological vulnerability. Based on a qualitative desk review and analyses of secondary data, resilience is framed as a function of the adaptive, absorptive and transformative capacity of socio-political systems to withstand and cope with the adverse effects of disaster. In addition, this study emphasizes the major principles and components of effective big data use; e.g., open source tools, strong infrastructure, local skill development, context-specific data sources, ethical data sharing and experiential learning. This study reveals some important big data technologies that can be easily used in the different phases of disaster management and enhancing resilience such as remote sensing imagery, social media data, crowdsourced data, geographic information system (GIS), and mobile metadata. The findings hold major relevancy for policymakers, administrators, and related stakeholders responsible for taking action before, during and after disasters through training, early warning systems, emergency evacuation, relief distribution and other key infrastructural components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Disaster management; Governance; Resilience; Risk management",,,,,,"Sarker, M.N.I., Wu, M., Alam, G.M., Shouse, R.C., Livelihood vulnerability of riverine-island dwellers in the face of natural disasters in Bangladesh (2019) Sustainability, 11, p. 1623; Fahad, S., Wang, J., Climate change, vulnerability, and its impacts in rural Pakistan: a review (2020) Environ.

Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL  33620, United States","Building resilience in critical infrastructures for smart and connected cities requires consideration of different types of interdependencies. Previous research has mainly conceptualized three types of interdependencies including cyber, physical, and social. To develop resilient and sustainable design, operations, and managerial strategies, domain knowledge for each infrastructure along with its organizational characteristics needs to be integrated with those of other infrastructures. In this review paper, an infrastructure-oriented approach is taken to systematically examine different types of interdependencies and resilience quantification techniques for water, transportation, and cyber infrastructures. Design, operations, and managerial strategies are identified and categorized into short-term, mid-term, and long-term plans that can potentially improve the resilience and sustanability of the underlying infrastructures. Future research needs, in terms of resilience metrics, interdependency, and strategies, are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Infrastructure interdependency; Integration; Resilience metrics; Sustainable design strategies","Cyber Physical System; Managers; Cyber infrastructures; Cyber physicals; Domain knowledge; Long-term plans; Organizational characteristics; Research needs; Resilience metrics; Review papers; Sustainable development",,,,,"AASHTO, Understanding Transportation Resilience: A 2016–2018 roadmap (2017), AASHTO; Abchirm, B., Basabe, P., United Nations international strategy for disaster reduction (2003) Living with risk, pp. 1-412; Abdel-Mottaleb, N., Ghasemi Saghand, P., Charkhgard, H., Zhang, Q., An exact multiobjective optimization approach for evaluating water distribution infrastructure criticality and geospatial interdependence (2019) Water Resources Research, 55 (7), pp. 5255-5276; Adger, W.N., Social and ecological resilience: are they related?

Nevertheless, community resilience is complex, contextual, multifaceted, and therefore hard to define, recognise, and operationalise. An essential advantage of having a complete process for community resilience is the capacity to be aware of and respond appropriately in times of adversity. A three-step process constituting of modelling, measurement, and visualisation is crucial to determine components, to assess value, and to represent information of community resilience, respectively. The goal of this review is to offer a general overview of multiple perspectives for modelling, measuring, and visualising community resilience derived from related and emerging studies, projects, and tools. By engaging throughout the entire process, which involves three sequential steps as we mentioned above, communities can discover important components of resilience, optimise available local and natural resources, and mitigate the impact of impairments effectively and efficiently. To this end, we conduct a systematic review of 77 different literature records published from 2000 to 2020, concentrating on five research questions. We believe that researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can utilise this paper as a potential reference and a starting point to surpass current hindrances as well as to sharpen their future research directions. © 2020 by the authors.","Community resilience; Information visualisation; Knowledge representation; Resilience assessment; Resilience modelling; Systematic overview","literature review; modeling; natural resource; policy making; spatiotemporal analysis",,,,,"Alexander, D.E., Resilience and Disaster Risk Reduction: An Etymological Journey (2013) Nat.

In order to address this situation, countries and communities have developed strategies to reduce risk levels of critical infrastructure systems and, therefore, improve their resilience. Among critical infrastructure systems, the production and distribution of drinking water is essential to ensure the recovery of society. Despite the importance of evaluating the resilience of critical infrastructures, in general, and drinking water systems, in particular, there is no universal definition or methodology for this. The present study conducted a comprehensive literature review regarding the concept and methodologies to evaluate the resilience of critical infrastructures, with special emphasis on drinking water systems. Based on this review, a definition of resilient drinking water system is proposed. Moreover, it has been evidenced that the evaluation of resilience should not only consider the technical dimension, but also the environmental, organizational, social and economic dimensions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Critical infrastructure; Drinking water; Literature review; Natural hazard; Resilience",,,,,,"UNISDR (United Nations office for Disaster Risk Reduction), Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (2015), https://www.preventionweb.net/files/43291_sendaiframeworkfordrren.pdf, Available at:; Heo, B.-Y., Heo, W.-H., Economic analysis of disaster management investment effectiveness in Korea (2019) Sustainability (Switzerland), 11 (11), p. 3011; Lowrance, W., Of Acceptable Risk—Science and the Determination of Safety (1976), William Kaufmann Inc Los Altos, CA; Renn, O., Risk Governance (2005), International Risk Governance Council Geneva White paper no. 1; Romero, G., Maskrey, A., Cómo Entender Los Desastres Naturales.

Uncertainty associated with climate change has resulted in a shift towards flood resilience as it helps deal with unexpected climatic perturbations that impact extreme flows. The concept of resilience has increased in popularity, leading to a multitude of definitions, measurements and applications. This paper systematically reviews the FRM literature to provide clarity on the differing perspectives of resilience and how they influence successful implementation of the concept. Our analysis assesses where FRM is positioned within three pre-defined interdisciplinary understandings of resilience. The polysemic nature of resilience has produced a multitude of different perspectives that prevent successful operationalisation. Resilience is interdisciplinary; therefore it requires integration between top-down and bottom-up FRM approaches, as well as a more holistic approach to the interdependence between temporal and spatial scales. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The concept of resilience has been introduced into urban transportation systems to reduce the consequences of its disruptions. Recently, this concept has attracted considerable interest from researchers from different areas of transportation and mobility. However, several investigations about this issue were carried out under different perspectives, resulting in a more comprehensive concept, which includes adapting and transforming systems for different levels of equilibrium. This article provides a thorough and conceptual review of resilience applied to urban transportation systems focusing on its definitions, characteristics, and quantification methods. Based on this, the evaluation of the level of resilience of mobility subsystems is discussed to provide the basic framework for generating a tool to assess the resilience of the urban transportation system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Resilience; Transportation system; Urban networks; Urban transportation modes","mobility; transportation system; urban transport",,,,,"Abdel-Hamid, T.K., Madnick, S.E., Software Project Dynamics: An Integrated Approach (1991), Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs NJ; Adams, T.M., Bekkem, K.R., Toledo-Durán, E.J., Freight resilience measures (2012) J.

Assessing community resilience to disasters is, therefore, an essential step toward mitigating their current and future risks. This study provides a systematic review of coastal community resilience frameworks for disaster risk management, covering their content, structure, and assessment. Sixty-four critical resilience criteria under four dimensions are identified by analyzing the convergence and divergence of the consideration of assessment indicators in the reviewed frameworks. Existing frameworks focus mostly on ‘governance and institutions,’ ‘infrastructure,’ and ‘society and the economy.’ Despite significant risks, the impacts on the environment and potential risks of climate change are not prioritized. Only 22% of the frameworks consider future risks, rendering the remainder inadequate for assessing projected risks from climate change. None of the frameworks consulted the full spectrum of stakeholders (public, government, and experts) during the development process, which compromised their applicability, acceptability, and effectiveness. 56% of the frameworks considered a single hazard type. Community resilience is inherently multi-dimensional. Therefore, the interrelationships between multiple hazards should be adequately addressed in future frameworks. © 2020, The Author(s).","Assessment framework; Coastal communities; Coastal hazards; Disaster risk management; Resilience indicators","climate change; coastal zone; disaster management; hazard assessment; risk assessment; stakeholder",,,,,"Ainuddin, S., Routray, J.K., Community resilience framework for an earthquake prone area in Baluchistan (2012) Int J Disaster Risk Reduct, 2, pp. 25-36; Alshehri, S.A., Rezgui, Y., Li, H., Disaster community resilience assessment method: a consensus-based Delphi and AHP approach (2015) Nat Hazards, 78, pp. 395-416; Ameen, R.F.M., Mourshed, M., Urban sustainability assessment framework development: the ranking and weighting of sustainability indicators using analytic hierarchy process (2018) Sustain Cities Soc, 44, pp. 356-366; Ameen, R.F.M., Mourshed, M., Li, H., A critical review of environmental assessment tools for sustainable urban design (2015) Environ Impact Assess Rev, 55, pp. 110-125; Arbon, P., Developing a model and tool to measure community disaster resilience (2014) Aust J Emerg Manag, 29 (4), pp. 12-16; Arbon, P., Steenkamp, M., Cornell, V., Cusack, L., Gebbie, K., Measuring disaster resilience in communities and households: pragmatic tools developed in Australia (2016) Int J Disaster Resil Built Environ, 7, pp. 201-215; Bealt, J., Mansouri, S.A., From disaster to development: a systematic review of community-driven humanitarian logistics (2018) Disasters, 42 (1), pp. 124-148; Burton, C.G., A validation of metrics for community resilience to natural hazards and disasters using the recovery from Hurricane Katrina as a case study (2015) Ann As Am Geogr, 105, pp. 67-86; Chandra, A., Acosta, J.D., Howard, S., Uscher-Pines, L., Williams, M.V., Yeung, D., Garnett, J., Meredith, L.S., (2011) Building community resilience to disasters: a way forward to enhance national health security, , RAND Corporation, Santa Monica; Chelleri, L., Waters, J.J., Olazabal, M., Minucci, G., Resilience trade-offs: addressing multiple scales and temporal aspects of urban resilience (2015) Environ Urban, 27, pp. 181-198; Cimellaro, G.P., Renschler, C., Reinhorn, A.M., Arendt, L., PEOPLES: a framework for evaluating resilience (2016) J Struct Eng, 142, p. 04016063; Cohen, O., Bolotin, A., Lahad, M., Goldberg, A., Aharonson-Daniel, L., Increasing sensitivity of results by using quantile regression analysis for exploring community resilience (2016) Ecol Ind, 66, pp. 497-502; Collier, M.J., Nedovic-Budic, Z., Aerts, J., Connop, S., Foley, D., Foley, K., Newport, D., Verburg, P., Transitioning toresilience and sustainability in urban communities (2013) Cities, 32, pp. S21-S28; Cooper, R., Boyko, C., How to design a city in five easy steps: exploring VivCity 2020’s process and tools for urban design decision making?

While methods for mapping hazard, vulnerability and risk are well established, mapping resilience in urban areas poses a challenge as there are no agreed-on methodological approaches for doing so. This paper surveys proposed methodologies and approaches for mapping urban resilience to disasters. Our review shows that (1) adaptive resilience is mapped after a disaster mainly through the measure of recovery and inherent resilience is mapped using top-down approaches. Regarding inherent resilience (2), very few methods have been applied at city scale; (3) the limit between resilience and vulnerability mapping is still narrow and may cause confusion for decision makers; (4) the choice of variables and indicators to measure and map resilience is often a function of data availability and reliability; (5) indicators developed in one specific context should not be applied systematically to other contexts as resilience is a context-dependent concept; (6) most resilience maps are based on an analytical approach and do not reflect the systemic property of resilience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GIS; Map; Resilience indicators; Urban resilience","Decision making; Disasters; Geographic information systems; Mapping; Maps; Analytical approach; Context dependent; Data availability; Decision makers; Methodological approach; Top down approaches; Urban resilience; Vulnerability mappings; Information management",,,,,"Alexander, D.E., Resilience and disaster risk reduction: An etymological journey (2013) Natural Hazards and Earth System Science, 13, pp. 2707-2716; Asadzadeh, A., Kötter, T., Salehi, P., Birkmann, J., Operationalizing a concept: The systematic review of composite indicator building for measuring community disaster resilience (2017) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 25, pp. 147-162; Aydin, N.Y., Duzgun, H.S., Wenzel, F., Integration of stress testing with graph theory to assess the resilience of urban road networks under seismic hazards (2018) Natural Hazards, 91 (1), pp. 37-68; Bates, S., Angeon, V., Ainouche, A., The pentagon of vulnerability and resilience: A methodological proposal in development economics by using graph theory (2014) Economic Modelling, 42, pp. 445-453; Bergstrand, K., Mayer, B., Brumback, B., Zhang, Y., Assessing the relationship between social vulnerability and community resilience to hazards (2015) Social Indicators Research, 122 (2), pp. 391-409; Bertilsson, L., Wiklund, K., Tebaldi, I.D.M., Rezende, O.M., Urban flood resilience – A multi-criteria index to integrate flood resilience into urban planning (2018) Journal of Hydrology, 573, pp. 970-982; Biggs, R., Schlüter, M., Schoon, M.L., Building principles for resilience: Sustaining ecosystem services in social-ecological systems (2015), University Press, Cambridge Cambridge 2015; Bozza, A., Asprone, D., Manfredi, G., A methodological framework assessing disaster resilience of city ecosystems to enhance resource use efficiency (2017) International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development, 9 (2), pp. 136-150; Bozza, A., Asprone, D., Parisi, F., Manfredi, G., Alternative resilience indices for city ecosystems subjected to natural hazards (2017) Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 32 (7), pp. 527-545; Bruneau, M., Chang, S.E., Eguchi, R.T., Lee, G.C., O'Rourke, T.D., Reinhorn, A.M., A framework to quantitatively assess and enhance the seismic resilience of communities (2003) Earthquake Spectra, 19 (4), pp. 733-752; Cai, H., Lam, N.S.-N., Qiang, Y., Li, K., Assessing community resilience to coastal hazards in the Lower Mississippi River Basin (2016) Water, 8 (2), pp. 1-18; Cariolet, J.-M., Colombert, M., Vuillet, M., Diab, Y., Assessing the resilience of urban areas to traffic-related air pollution: Application in Greater Paris (2018) The Science of the Total Environment, 615, pp. 588-596; Carpenter, S., Walker, B., Anderies, J.M., Abel, N., From Metaphor to Measurement: Resilience of What to What?

The goal consists of identifying and understanding the indicators used to evaluate organizational resilience and instigating the development of indicators to assess resilience in other areas, such as project management and critical infrastructure. Design/methodology/approach: A review of recent empirical studies is conducted to collect information on the indicators used to assess organizational resilience. Findings: A range of interrelated indicators aiming to measure organizational resilience in two dimensions is shown in this literature review: awareness and adaptive capacity. Awareness is the ability of an organization to assess its environment and interpret the changes in its surroundings, both now and in the future, to be proactive and better manage possible disruptive events. On the other hand, adaptive capacity is the organization’s capacity to transform its structure, processes, culture, etc. for recovering once faced with a disruptive event. Awareness forms the main base of the organization’s adaptive capacity. Originality/value: Organizational resilience contributes to the safe development of the built environment. This concept helps organizations to cope with disruptions. However, little research has been conducted on the indicators to assess organizational resilience, in different fields. Moreover, these indicators’ credibility is based on empirical studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive capacity; Awareness; Empirical studies; Indicators; Organizational resilience; Resilience","adaptive management; empirical analysis; literature review; methodology; project management",,,,,"Akgün, A.E., Keskin, H., Organisational resilience capacity and firm product innovativeness and performance (2014) International Journal of Production Research, 52 (23), pp. 6918-6937; Barasa, E., Mbau, R., Gilson, L., What is resilience and how can it be nurtured?

However, the quantification of this social support, primarily through its recognition as social capital, has proven problematic as there is no singular method for its measurement, invalidating the credibility of studies that try to correlate its effects with community disaster resilience. Within the wider resilience field, research that specifically utilises social networks as the focus of analysis is evolving. This paper provides a critical synthesis of how this developing discourse is filtering into community disaster resilience, reviewing empirical case studies from the Global South within DRR that use social network analysis and connectivity measurement. Our analysis of these studies indicates that a robust methodology utilising social network analysis is emerging, which offers opportunity for research cross-comparability. Our review also finds that without this bottom-up mapping, the implementation of top-down preparedness policy and procedures are likely to fail, resulting in the advocation of social network analysis as a critical methodology in future resilience research and policy planning. © 2019 by the authors.","Community disaster resilience; Connectivity; Data; Disaster risk reduction; Innovation; Social network analysis; Social network mapping; Social networks","community resource management; connectivity; data assimilation; disaster management; implementation process; innovation; network analysis; policy approach; risk assessment; social capital; social network; top-down approach",,,,,"Patel, S.S., Rogers, M.B., Amlôt, R., Rubin, G.J., What Do We Mean by 'Community Resilience'?.

This paper critically reviews existing frameworks and methods to understand their application in a disaster context, to highlight key challenges and future directions for developing robust social resilience assessment frameworks. The analysis revealed a lack of consistency in key concepts used to measure social resilience to disasters. This results in significant confusion in the way key concepts are understood, interpreted, and applied. Due to the multi-faceted nature of social resilience concepts, there are pronounced theoretical and practical difficulties in carrying out a rapid, but rational, accurate, and meaningful assessment of social resilience to disasters. Many of the key process-oriented indicators are not included in the existent social resilience frameworks, since they are not easy to operationalise due to their dynamic nature. Therefore, a comprehensive social resilience framework that can be adapted to different contexts and integrated with specific measurement tools and guidelines is necessary. Such a comprehensive framework can make resilience measurement consistent across geographies by adapting it with context specific resilience characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Community resilience; Disaster management; Disaster resilience; Resilience indicators; Resilience measurement",,,,,,"McMillen, H., Campbell, L., Svendsen, E., Reynolds, R., Recognizing stewardship practices as indicators of social resilience: in living memorials and in a community garden (2016) Sustainability, 8 (8), p. 775; Quinlan, A.E., Berbés‐Blázquez, M., Haider, L.J., Peterson, G.D., Measuring and assessing resilience: broadening understanding through multiple disciplinary perspectives (2016) J.

Developing tools or metrics for measuring and monitoring progress of resilience is a critical component that requires extensive research to achieve better understanding. However, different fields have different emphases and the knowledge gained from the various studies are scattered and fragmented. To provide an integration of the literature and reflect on the current state of resilience measurement, we conducted a synthesis analysis through a systematic review of 174 scholarly articles on disaster resilience measurement from 2005 to 2017. Using a review table designed for this study and content analysis, we extracted key information from each article on resilience definition, type of measurement method, resilience indicators used, and proposed adaptation strategies. Results indicate that 39.7% of the articles used qualitative methods for resilience measurement and 39.1% of the articles used quantitative methods. However, only 10.3% of all the 174 articles conducted empirical validation of their proposed resilience indices. The three most frequently suggested adaptation strategies were empowering local governments and leaders, raising community awareness, and enhancing community infrastructure and communication. These findings suggest that future research need to incorporate validation and inferential ability into resilience measurement. Extending from static resilience measurement to dynamic system modeling and bridging the disconnection between resilience scientific research and practical actions are also pressing needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategies; Disaster resilience measurement; Resilience indices; Synthesis analysis; Validation",,,,,,"Ainuddin, S., Routray, J.K., Earthquake hazards and community resilience in Baluchistan (2012) Nat.

This paper presents an inclusive and adaptive ‘5S’ social resilience framework that was developed based on the critical review of existing social resilience frameworks discussed in the literature. The proposed social resilience framework consists of five sub-dimensions of social resilience, namely, social structure, social capital, social mechanisms, social equity, and social belief, a set of 16 characteristics, and corresponding 46 indicators. While the key social resilience characteristics are integrated within a single framework, it is flexible enough for adapting to a specific context as needed. Key challenges in resilience measurement approaches developed in disaster management context are also highlighted in this paper. The direct measures of social resilience are resource intensive. Hence, proxy measures have been widely used using data available in the public domain which often result in inadequate measurement of social resilience. It is imperative to explore use of surrogates in measuring social resilience characteristics that are complex and not easily measurable directly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community resilience; Disaster management; Disaster resilience; Resilience assessment; Resilience indicator",,,,,,"UNISDR, (2015), Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015–2030., United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction; CRED, (2016), What is the human cost of weather-related disasters (1995–2015)?, in CRED Crunch., EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International DisasterDatabase: Belgium; Aldunce, P., Beilin, R., Howden, M., Handmer, J., Resilience for disaster risk management in a changing climate: practitioners' frames and practices (2015) Glob.

Resilience is measured in isolation in some cases, where a shock is perceived to arise external to the system of interest. Problematically, this contradicts the way in which the climate change and disaster communities perceive risk as manifesting itself endogenously as a function of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability. The common conceptualisation of resilience as predominantly positive is problematic as well when, in reality, many undesirable properties of a system are resilient. Consequently, this paper presents an integrative framework that highlights the interactions between risk drivers and coping, adaptive, and transformative capacities, providing an improved conceptual basis for resilience measurement. © 2018 The Author(s).

Despite this growing trend, there is neither an agreement upon a standard procedure nor a comprehensive assessment of existing measurement frameworks in the relevant literature. To tackle these challenges, this study (1) proposes an overarching eight-step procedure for composite indicator building and (2) develops a meta-level assessment framework to allow for a systematic review of existing disaster resilience measurement frameworks in application of composite indicator building. This meta-level framework was established on the basis of the proposed eight-step composite indicator building procedure and qualified with the introduction of 19 dimensions and 36 metrics for quality assessment. In order to select relevant disaster resilience measures for this analysis, the study applied a systematic survey to collect measures based on four inclusion criteria: community-based, multifaceted, quantitative, and operationalized. Accordingly, 17 resilience measurement frameworks were chosen for further analysis in this review. The results of the quality assessment demonstrated that, from the theoretical perspective, resilience assessments originate from either the socio-ecological or engineering fields and can be classified into two main types of resilience indices and tools. This differs from results of the methodological perspective, which indicate that resilience measures can be characterized as deductive or similar to hierarchical and inductive assessments. © 2017 The Author(s)","Composite indicators building (CIB); Disaster resilience; Operationalizing; Systematic survey",,,,,,"Alexander, D., What can we do about earthquakes?

Since resilience is a multidisciplinary term, it is important to review what has been achieved in the wastewater sector, and describe the future research directions for the forthcoming years. This work presents a critical review of studies that deal with resilience in the wastewater treatment sector, with a special focus on understanding how they addressed the key elements for assessing resilience, such as stressors, system properties, metrics and interventions to increase resilience. The results showed that only 17 peer-reviewed papers and 6 relevant reports, a small subset of the work in wastewater research, directly addressed resilience. The lack of consensus in the definition of resilience, and the elements of a resilience assessment, is hindering the implementation of resilience in wastewater management. To date, no framework for resilience assessment is complete, comprehensive or directly applicable to practitioners; current examples are lacking key elements (e.g. a comprehensive study of stressors, properties and metrics, examples of cases study, ability to benchmark interventions or connectivity with broader frameworks). Furthermore, resilience is seen as an additional cost or extra effort, instead of a means to overcome project uncertainty that could unlock new opportunities for investment. © 2017 The Authors","Management; Resilience; Sewer systems; Wastewater; WRRF","Future research directions; Key elements; Resilience; Sewer system; State of the art; Systems management; Urban wastewater; Waste water systems; Wastewater management; WRRF; adaptive management; assessment method; connectivity; government; guideline; project assessment; sewer network; theoretical study; waste management; wastewater treatment; city planning; conceptual framework; ecosystem resilience; investment; priority journal; Review; sewage; sewer; urban area; waste water management; waste water recycling; city; human; uncertainty; waste water; waste water; Cities; Humans; Uncertainty; Waste Water",,"Waste Water",,,"100 RC, 100 resilient Cities (2013), http://www.100resilientcities.org/resilience#/-_/, [ONLINE] Available at: [Accessed 23 September 2016]; Butler, D., Farmani, R., Fu, G., Ward, S., Diao, K., Astaraie-Imani, M., A new approach to urban water management: safe and sure (2014) Procedia Eng., 89, pp. 347-354; Butler, D., Ward, S., Sweetapple, C., Astaraie-Imani, M., Diao, K., Farmani, R., Fu, G., Reliable, resilient and sustainable water management: the Safe & SuRe approach (2016) Glob.

To operationalize this concept and reduce the ambiguities surrounding it, since the turn of the century, various resilience assessment methodologies have been introduced. This paper provides a critical review of 36 selected community resilience assessment tools. These tools have been developed by a variety of entities, including national and local organizations, international donor organizations, and academic researchers. First, an overview of the selected tools is presented. This overview analysis shows that while some commonalities exist, there are also considerable differences between the tools. Next, based on literature review, an analytical framework is developed that identifies six criteria for evaluating performance of resilience assessment tools. These are, namely, addressing multiple dimensions of resilience, accounting for cross-scale relationships, capturing temporal dynamism, addressing uncertainties, employing participatory approaches, and developing action plans. Results show that limited success has been achieved in addressing these criteria. In terms of comprehensiveness, the environmental dimension has received relatively less attention in spite of its significance for building community resilience. Further improvements are needed to account for dynamics over time and across space. More attention to employing iterative processes that involve scenario-based planning is needed to better address challenges associated with uncertainties. Results also show that more attention needs to be paid to stakeholder participation in developing assessment tools. The paper concludes by highlighting several other areas of weakness that need to be addressed and discussing major challenges that still remain. © 2016 The Author(s).

Continuity of energy supply in cities is affected by climate change and a growing array of other threats such as cyber attacks, terrorism, technical deficiencies, and market volatility. Determined efforts, acknowledging the interactions and interlinkages between energy and other sectors, are needed to avoid adverse consequences of disruption in energy supply. Resilience thinking is an approach to management of socio-ecological systems that aims to develop an integrated framework for bringing together the (often) fragmented, diverse research on disaster risk management. The literature on urban resilience is immense and still growing. This paper reviews literature related to energy resilience to develop a conceptual framework for assessing urban energy resilience, identify planning and design criteria that can be used for assessing urban energy resilience, and examine the relationship of these criteria with the underlying components of the conceptual framework. In the conceptual framework, it is proposed that in order to be resilient, urban energy system needs to be capable of “planning and preparing for”, “absorbing”, “recovering from”, and “adapting” to any adverse events that may happen in the future. Integrating these four abilities into the system would enable it to continuously address “availability”, “accessibility”, “affordability”, and “acceptability” as the four sustainability-related dimensions of energy. The paper explains different resilience principles associated with these abilities and sustainability dimensions. Also, different planning and design criteria were extracted from the literature and categorized into five themes: infrastructure; resources; land use, urban geometry and morphology; governance; and socio-demographic aspects and human behavior. Examination of the relationship of these criteria with the underlying components of the conceptual framework highlighted the complexity and multi-faceted nature of energy resilience. Exploration of the relevance of the identified criteria to climate change mitigation and adaptation revealed that most of the identified criteria can provide both mitigation and adaptation benefits. © 2016 The Authors","Assessment; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Criteria; Principles; Resilience; Sustainability; Urban energy","Behavioral research; Climate change; Energy resources; Land use; Network security; Risk management; Terrorism; Urban planning; Assessment; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Conceptual frameworks; Criteria; Energy; Energy supplies; Principle; Resilience; Urban energy; Sustainable development",,,,,"Vale, L.J., Campanella, T.J., The resilient city: how modern cities recover from disaster (2005), Oxford University Press New York; Roggema, R., van den Dobbelsteen, A., Swarm planning for climate change: an alternative pathway for resilience (2012) Build Res Inform, 40, pp. 606-624; Stocker, T., Climate change 2013: the physical science basis: Working Group I contribution to the Fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014), Cambridge University Press New York; Colding, J., ׳Ecological land-use complementation׳ for building resilience in urban ecosystems (2007) Landsc Urban Plan, 81, pp. 46-55; Moss, T., Socio-technical change and the politics of urban infrastructure: managing energy in berlin between dictatorship and democracy (2013) Urban Stud, 51, pp. 1432-1448; Fleischhauer, M., The role of spatial planning in strengthening urban resilience (2008) Nato Sci Peace Secur, pp. 273-298; Sharifi, A., Yamagata, Y., (2014), pp. 1-5. , Major principles and criteria for development of an urban resilience assessment index.

However, its application has been influenced by the lack of assessment tools. This study reviews studies conducted using the resilience concept and examines the tools, models, and methods adopted. It examines the domains, indicators, and indices have been considered in the tools. It provides a critical analysis of the assessment tools available for evaluating community disaster resilience (CDR). Methods: We investigated international electronic databases including Scopus, MEDLINE through PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), and Google Scholar with no limitation on date, and type of articles. The search terms and strategy were as follow: (Disaster* OR Emergenc*) AND (Resilience OR Resilient OR Resiliency) that were applied for titles, abstracts and keywords. Extracted data were analyzed in terms of studied hazards, types of methodology, domains, and indicators of CDR assessment. Results: Of 675 publications initially identified, the final analysis was conducted on 17 full text articles. These studies presented ten models, tools, or indices for CDR assessment. These evinced a diverse set of models with regard to the domains, indicators and the kind of hazard described. Considerable inter dependency between and among domains and indicators also emerged from this analysis. Conclusion: The disparity between the articles using the resilience concept and those that offer some approach to measurement (675 vs. 17) indicates the conceptual and measurement complexity in CDR and the fact that the concept may be being used without regard to how CDR should be operationalized and assessed. Of those that have attempted to assess CDR, the level of conceptual diversity indicates limited agreement about how to operationalize the concept. As a way forward we summarize the models identified in the literature and suggest that, as a starting point for the systematic operationalization of CDR, that existing indicators of community disaster resilience be classified in five domains. These are social, economic, institutional, physical and natural domains. A need to use appropriate and effective methods to quantify and weigh them with regard to their relative contributions to resilience is identified, as is a need to consider how these levels interrelate to influence resilience. Although assessment of disaster resilience especially at the community level will inform disaster risk reduction strategies, attempts to systematically do so are in preliminary phases. Further empirical investigation is needed to develop a operational and measurable CDR model. © 2015, Public Library of Science.
