# Meta Review Using NLP Techniques

Hi! This is the GitHub repository for my first PhD paper at Maastricht University.

The NWA-funded consortium I am a member of is called RED&BLUE. You can read more about our consortium here: <https://redblueclimate.nl>

This repository will be updated periodically. This repository will then also serve as the code and data point for anything that is related for this project.
