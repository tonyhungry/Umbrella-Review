<p>The literature search started with an experimental search in March 2023. The aim of the experimental search of literature is to scout the volume and diversity of the available literature. It was evident from this experiment that there exists a colossal amount of reviews on resilience and not all reviews are equal. This experiment was helpful in further determining the exclusion and inclusion criteria and optimizing the search query as well as the steps for screening review articles.</p>
<p>The Scopus search for literature was conducted on the 3rd of April 2023. There are no publication date limitations, which means that any publication published on or before 3rd of April 2023 are accepted. The review process was assisted by using Rayyan. The schematic, adapted PRISMA representation is shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="images/PRISMA Flowchart.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">PRISMA flow chart</figcaption>

</div>
<p>The main keywords used in the query for searching on the Scopus database in titles, abstracts, and keywords were “soci*”, “commun*”, “neighbour*”, “urban”, “econom*”, “financi*”, “infrastruct*”, “disast*”, “climate” and “resilience”. This search query is further restricted by excluding the following keywords in the title-abstract-key: “covid”, “corona”, “COVID-19”, “agri*”, “supply chain”, “agro*”, “land”, “education”, “migration”, “sport”, “war”, “coral”, “farm*” and restricted again with the following keywords in the title: “politics”, “policy”, “ecosystem”, “forest”, “worker”, “governance”, “river”, “ecolo*”, “biodiversity”, “institution*”, since it is out of scope for the paper. The document type is set to reveal review journal articles only. Obvious subject areas such as medicine, agricultural and biological sciences, psychology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, computer science, neuroscience, nursing, immunology and microbiology, chemical engineering, health professions, physics and astronomy, chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutics, veterinary, dentistry, arts and humanities, business, management and accounting, mathematics, and materials science are all excluded. The language of the review articles is limited to English only. Finally, the search query specifies the following keywords that should appear for inclusion: resilience, climate change,, disasters, and disaster. This search query<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> resulted in 446 articles in total.</p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria of review articles are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>Learning from the experimental search exercise, it was difficult to determine if an article was truly a review article or not by simply scanning from the title, abstract and keywords. It was interesting to point out that even though the filter for review articles was switched on, there were still a myriad of articles that were not review articles to begin with. To further simplify the process, an additional line<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in the search query was appended, where it only includes articles that mentions “review”, “overview”, or “survey” in either title, abstract, or keyword. This additional exclusion resulted in 341 articles awaiting to be screened.</p>
<p>Following the screening of 341 articles, 256 articles were removed due to not being in scope with this paper. The main reasons for removing the articles was that the articles focused on sustainability, nature (such as forests or lakes), governance, health, particular species (such as beetles or plants), technology, etc. Furthering the screening and filtering of articles, 85 reviews were under full-text screening. The purpose of full-text screening is to ensure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. A substantial portion of the articles were removed either due to not being a systematic review or simply not being a review article.</p>
<p>After the full-text screening, the remaining 21 articles were controlled using the Methodological Quality Checklist &lt;insert citation here, Bird article&gt;. The checklist consists of 7 questions, and for each question, if the review satisfy the requirement or question, the review receives 1 point, which results in 7 full possible points. The checklist is slightly adapted for question 1, where if there is a clear aim or purpose for the review, then the review itself would satisfy the question. Following the example of Bird (2018), this meta review would include any review that received four or more points, as those were “deemed moderate-to-high quality” (Bird, 2018). Although the checklist may appear simple, but it was a rather effective astringent in determining the quality of the review articles. All except one review satisfy question 5 of the checklist, which asked if the primary studies have been quality assessed. The other question where only 2 reviews satisfied, was about if each stage of the review process have been involved by at least two authors. Finally, this umbrella review proceeds with analysis and synthesis with 11 systematic reviews. The table below lists the final 11 reviews synthesized in this paper.</p>

<p>The synthesis and analysis of the 11 review articles are guided by the following two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How is resilience defined and manifested as indicators in the different resilience streams?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the commonalities between these different resilience streams in definition and indicators?</p></li>

<p>Of the 11 articles examined in this article, 7 papers could be classified as related to measuring the resilience of infrastructures, 2 papers concerns community resilience, 1 paper on organizational resilience, and another paper on urban resilience. The years of publication of the included articles spans from 2017 to 2023. This is unsurprising as systematic reviews were originally from the field of health and only started diversifying in the early 2000s <code>Systematic reviews: A brief historical overview</code>. The total number of articles that were included in the 11 papers is 829 articles, with an average of 75.4 articles and standard deviation of 74 articles. Furthermore, the paper with the least amount of articles is <code>coastal community paper</code>, with 9 articles reviewed and the paper with the highest amount of articles is <code>infrastructure resilience curves</code> with 273 papers. The median of articles included for review across all papers is 50.</p>
<p>The average number of authors across the 11 review articles is 3.5, with a standard deviation of 1.6. The highest amount of authorship in a paper is 7 <code>Resilience theory article</code>, and the least amount of authors in a review paper is 1 <code>Indicators to assess article</code>. Out of the 11 articles included in this article, 6 were published by Elsevier, 3 by Emerald, 1 by Springer and another 1 by Taylor &amp; Francis. The 11 articles also demonstrated the use of different database in their literature search, with an average of 1.6 databases consulted. Scopus was the most popular database, with 7 uses, which follows closely with Web of Science with 6 uses. The other databases consulted were Google Scholar (2 instances), ScienceDirect (2 instances), and IEEE Xplore (1 instance).</p>

<p>The various definitions are scraped from each review paper. Some papers try to synthesize the definition of resilience <code>put some example papers here and their citation\</code>, and some papers will propose their own definition of resilience <code>example papers here</code>, while a paper (Cariolet) will simply use a widely cited definition. This particular sub-section aims to explore the conceptualization of social and infrastructure resilience through the various definitions mentioned using word clouds and term frequency (and maybe more?)</p>

<p><em>“The concept of resilience was firstly introduced in a study on ecological systems by Holling, defining the ability of these systems to absorb and maintain changes in environmental variables.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilience is a characteristic that indicates system performance under unusual conditions, recovery speed, and the amount of outside assistance required for restoration to its original functional state.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilience is defined as the ability of the system to absorb the consequences of disruptions to reduce the impacts of disruptions and maintain freight mobility.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…defined as the adaptive capability of the supply chain to prepare for unexpected events, respond to disruptions, and recover from them by maintaining continuity of operations at desired levels of connectedness and control over structure and function.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The definition of resiliency ... is the ability for a transportation network to absorb disruptive events gracefully and return itself to a level of service equal to or greater than the pre-disruption level of service within a reasonable time frame.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilience deals with the response of the system in the face of shock and its ability to continue to provide the expected service delivery levels.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilient transportation systems enable quick evacuation, rescue, distribution of relief supplies, and other activities for reducing the impact of natural disasters and for accelerating the recovery from them.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It appears that resilience, conceived of as the capacity/ability of the system to absorb shocks without catastrophic changes in its basic functional organisation, is a potentially effective tool in understanding the evolutionary paths of complex spatial networks, such as transport and communication networks.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilience of a system refers to the ability to withstand disruptions within acceptable reduction in-service performance.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Resilience is the speed at which a system returns to equilibrium after a disturbance away from equilibrium.”</em></p>

<p><em>“… is the ability to maintain the operation of a system, while the economic counterpart is utilizing remaining resources as efficiently as possible in order to maintain the function performance of the system. This reflects the core of the economic problem based on how to best use scarce resources…”</em></p>
<p><em>“… refers to the ability and speed of recovery, where the economic counterpart pertains to investing wisely in repair and reconstruction. This is a dynamic consideration from the standpoint of economics because it involves a time trade-off diverting resources for investment represents setting aside current consumption to enhance productivity at future times.”</em></p></td>
